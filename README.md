# DOCKER-JENKINS-MASTER-AND-SLAVE


``` sh
In other words, by setting up a "cloud" environment, when Jenkins pipeline runs, it references the cloud setup and start up instances of the images as agents (slaves). The agents then can run various Jenkins tasks. After the pipeline is done, Jenkins will stop and remove the containers running those images.
